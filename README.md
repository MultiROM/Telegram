## edited by Felix @MultiROM (https://github.com/MultiROM/Telegram)
[Telegram](http://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. Itâ€™s superfast, simple and free.

This repo contains official but modded [Telegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger) source code.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE THINGS IN MY REPO ARE MODIFIED AND YOU CAN GET THE ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE @ https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram !!!

### API, Protocol documentation

Documentation for Telegram API is available here: http://core.telegram.org/api

Documentation for MTproto protocol is available here: http://core.telegram.org/mtproto
